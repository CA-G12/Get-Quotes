# üí° Get-Quotes.

**_Get-Quotes_**:  Week-3 API project for Code Academy: a website that gets quotes from an anime API and general quotes API.

## üìç Live Link:

You can check the live version out from [HERE](https://ca-g12.github.io/Get-Quotes/).

## üìç User journey:

- When the user first opens the webpage, he/she will find a description for the way he can search for quotes, a dropdown menu with two categories: (General topics & Anime) and a search bar.
- The *General topics* category will be chosen by default on the dropdown menu and the user can change it to *Anime*.
- The user has to type the name of the wanted topic or anime on the search bar, and click search.
- Once clicking on the search button, the user will get the quotes with the author/sayer in the quotes section.  

## üìç User story:
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the category.
- As a user, I want to be able to type the name of the topic or the anime I want to get quotes from.
- As a user, I want to be able to get quotes that match what I searched for with the author or the sayer of each of them.
